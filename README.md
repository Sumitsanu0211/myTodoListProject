# myTodoListProject
Hello people, This is my first project in React js, In this project i have created a Todo list in which we can add items, edit then and delete as well.
We can delete the entire list using "Remove all" button.
Some good things about this project is the data is stored in a local storage and will not be cleared whenever we refresh the browser, it reamins there.
I have applied basic HTML and CSS concept along with concept of React js. Inhave used Hooks such as useState hook, and useEffect hook to perform and manage various states.
